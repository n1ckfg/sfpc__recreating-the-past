# Recreating the Past (SFPC Summer 2016)

This repo contains my code for Zach Lieberman's class [Recreating the Past](https://github.com/ofZach/recreatingThePast_summer16) at the Summer 2016 session of SFPC. It's a pretty even mix of openFrameworks and p5.js, depending on what I was learning about at the time. There's also an inspiration folder. Each week has its own folder, and each week's folder has a `homework` folder where the homework lives.
